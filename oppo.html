<p id="oppo">Oppo recently launched the A5s in India at a price of Rs. 9,990, 
pitting it against some of the best value-for-money smartphones in the market including 
the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review) and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 (Review). The Oppo A5s is 
powered by the new MediaTek Helio P35 SoC along with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. 
The smartphone also packs in a big 4230mAh battery that should help it outlast the competition.
